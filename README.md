# JwtAuth
Authentification using jwt with Spring Boot and Vue.js
This is my practice in using Spring security.
Some mappings of my site are not available for non-authenticated users
The user can register. Its data is stored in the database of my local database (PostgreSQL).
After registration, he can go to the site and see previously unavailable information.
